"""The run recorder: machine timestamps, the gate token, and what else was running.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, IN ONE SENTENCE: every number this benchmark publishes was
produced by a process that started at some instant, ended at another, and shared
one Docker VM with whatever else happened to be running - and until now none of
those three facts was written down by the machine that knew them.

THE TIMESTAMPS ARE WRITTEN BY THE RUN, NEVER BY A HUMAN.
Both forms are stored. The local stamp carries a REAL offset, because a reader
asking "when was this measured" means the day it was on the machine; the UTC
counterpart sits beside it so two runs can be ordered without reasoning about
offsets. Both come from the shared core's now_local() / now_utc(). The naive UTC
constructor is never used: it returns a datetime carrying no timezone at all, so
a literal offset appended to it produces a string that claims what the object
never had. That failure type-checks, which is why it is worth a paragraph.

THE COST TRIPLE IS {api_spend_usd, gpu_minutes, wall_seconds}, ALL THREE REQUIRED.
This benchmark spends nothing on either, so both of the first two are recorded as
0.0. They are not OMITTED. An omitted key and a recorded zero are different
claims, and a reader doing `record.get("api_spend_usd", 0.0)` cannot tell them
apart - so a run that never recorded its cost would read, downstream, as a run
that was free.

`wall_seconds` is DERIVED from the handle and cannot be supplied. It is measured
on the monotonic clock rather than by subtracting the two wall-clock stamps, so a
clock adjustment or a DST transition mid-run cannot produce a negative duration.

WHAT ELSE WAS ON THE MACHINE, RECORDED PER RUN AND NOT ONCE.
`results/RESULTS.md` names "background load from other containers and builds on
the same machine" as the cause of the instability it discloses. That is a fact
about the environment a run happened in, and it is invisible after the fact
unless the run writes it down. So every run brackets itself with two container
censuses - `docker_contention` at the start and `docker_contention_at_finish` at
the end - and a container that appeared mid-run shows up as a difference between
them. A run with no contention evidence cannot honestly be compared with another.

The census records container NAMES, IMAGES and STATUS. It records no
environment, no command line and no mounted path, because a run record is not a
place a credential may land.

A RUN THAT CANNOT NAME ITS GATE IS REFUSED, NOT WRITTEN.
start_run() raises on an empty gate token. A record with no token cannot be tied
back to the gate that authorised it, so nothing downstream can tell it from a
measurement that ran without one - and that is the exact confusion the token
exists to prevent.
